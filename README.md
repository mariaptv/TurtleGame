## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the following modules:

- `turtle`: Built-in Python module used to generate graphics.
- `random`: Built-in Python module to generate random choices and colors.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/turtle-graphics.git
    cd turtle-graphics
    ```

2. Run the script:
